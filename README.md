# Space Explorer

## Project Overview

Space Explorer is an Android application that fetches and displays astronomy-related data from NASA's open APIs. The app features a clean, modern UI with a list view of space images and detailed information screens, along with multiple interactive features.

## Features

- **NASA API Integration**: Fetches astronomy pictures and data from NASA's APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) API
- **Modern UI**: Implements Material Design components with a space-themed color scheme
- **Fragment-Based Navigation**: Uses the Navigation Component for smooth transitions between screens
- **Responsive Design**: Works well in both portrait and landscape orientations
- **Rich Detail Views**: Displays comprehensive information about each astronomy picture
- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Share space images with friends
  - Open NASA website for more information
  - View videos when available
- **Image Loading**: Uses Glide for efficient image loading and caching
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Update content with a simple pull gesture
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network errors and loading states

## Project Structure

The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern and is organized into the following packages:

- **api**: Contains API service interfaces and network-related classes
- **models**: Data classes that represent the application's domain model
- **ui**: User interface components
  - **activities**: Main activity that hosts the navigation components
  - **adapters**: RecyclerView adapters for displaying data
  - **fragments**: UI fragments for different screens
  - **viewmodels**: ViewModels that manage UI-related data
- **utils**: Utility classes and helper functions

## Technical Specifications

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Minimum SDK**: 24 (Android 7.0 Nougat)
- **Target SDK**: 34 (Android 14)
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **API Communication**: Retrofit, OkHttp
- **Image Loading**: Glide
- **UI Components**: RecyclerView, CardView, ConstraintLayout
- **Navigation**: Navigation Component (JetPack)
- **Concurrency**: Kotlin Coroutines
- **Dependency Injection**: Koin

## API Usage

This app uses NASA's APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) API. To run the app, you'll need to:

1. Get an API key from [NASA's API portal](https://api.nasa.gov/)
2. Add your API key to the `app/build.gradle` file in the `defaultConfig` section:

```groovy
buildConfigField "String", "NASA_API_KEY", "\"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\""
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/space-explorer.git
```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Add your NASA API key as described in the API Usage section.

4. Build and run the app on your device or emulator.
